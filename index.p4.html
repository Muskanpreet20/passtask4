        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <p>These tasks have been instrumental in honing my web development skills. While working on them, I encountered challenges that pushed me to think critically and problem-solve creatively. Through this journey, I have not only gained technical expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue 3 but have also developed a deeper appreciation for the importance of responsive design and version control. I am excited to continue my growth as a web developer and embrace new challenges on this exciting journey.</p>
